# YAML formatter style spec

Canonical reference for the deterministic style rules that govern the in-tree
YAML formatter under `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/`.

These rules are deterministic (same input → same output) and small enough to fit
in one table. Rules 1--12 + 14 were cross-validated against pretty_yaml 0.6.0
and Prettier 3.6.2 on a 15-case battery of representative frontmatter --- both
agree on the spec; rule 6's bracket placement is the one point where they
differ, and the rule pins pretty_yaml's choice. Rule 13 (trailing newline) and
rule 14 (block-structural spacing) were cross-validated against pretty_yaml
later, during the Phase 1 corpus harness rollout.

pretty_yaml is the cross-validation reference because it implements the same
rules. It is not the source of truth: this document is. If the formatter
diverges from pretty_yaml on a case, one of the two is wrong relative to this
spec --- fix it; do not enumerate it. See `.claude/rules/yaml-formatter.md` for
the load-bearing invariants.

## Rules

1. **Indent.** 2 spaces, fully canonicalized regardless of input shape. Each
   content line's indent = `2 * (entry/item nesting depth − 1)` spaces, counting
   the line's containing `YAML_BLOCK_MAP_ENTRY` + `YAML_BLOCK_SEQUENCE_ITEM`
   ancestors. Root-level entries/items get 0 spaces. Tab-indented input is
   rejected by the in-tree parser outright, so the formatter never sees it.
   Multi-line plain / single-quoted / double-quoted scalar continuation lines
   indent at `2 * entry/item nesting depth` (one level deeper than the default
   --- the value column, not the key column), since the continuation belongs to
   the value side of the entry. Block-scalar (`|`/`>`) interior lines are
   currently preserved verbatim --- the indent sits inside one multi-line
   `YAML_SCALAR` token and full canonicalization needs a real block-scalar
   renderer (tracked separately; keeps pretty_yaml parity on already-canonical
   cases, diverges on non-canonical block-scalar indent).
2. **Sequence items** indented +2 from the parent key (`categories:\n  - foo`,
   never `- foo` at parent column).
3. **Quote style preference:** plain → double-quoted → single-quoted only when
   content contains characters that would need backslash-escaping in
   double-quoted form (e.g. `'C:\Users\test'`). Operationally, the formatter
   never adds or removes quoting from a scalar the user wrote plain or
   double-quoted --- those carry semantic intent (`true` the bool vs `"true"`
   the string). Single-quoted scalars are converted to double-quoted UNLESS the
   de-escaped content contains any of `\`, `'`, `"`, or an ASCII control
   character (0x00--0x1F or 0x7F). The control-char guard is conservative:
   pretty_yaml additionally generates `\t` / `\n` / etc. escapes when converting
   single → double, but the in-tree formatter keeps those as single-quoted
   instead --- frontmatter rarely has literal tabs or newlines in quoted
   scalars, and adding escape generation buys little. Single is preserved when
   content has `'` because that's the one case where converting (`'don''t'` →
   `"don't"`) would change the user's explicit choice of escape character
   without simplifying anything; pretty_yaml does the same.
4. **Block scalar style** (literal `|` vs folded `>`): preserved from input.
   They carry different YAML semantics and are not interchangeable.
5. **Flow spacing:** `{ key: value }` with one space inside braces; `[a, b, c]`
   with no space inside brackets, one space after each comma, one space after
   each `:`. Multi-line flow containers and flow containers with embedded
   `YAML_COMMENT` tokens are preserved verbatim (rule 6 owns multi-line wrap;
   in-flow comments are too rare to warrant their own canonicalization path). If
   the parser couldn't structure a flow map's contents into entries (e.g.
   `{key:value}`, no space to disambiguate `:`), the inner bytes are emitted
   verbatim between `{` and `}` --- matches pretty_yaml's "normalize spacing
   around structure, don't re-parse content" behavior.
6. **Flow wrap on line-width overflow:** each item on its own line, trailing
   comma, **opening bracket stays on the key line**
   (`keywords: [\n  first,\n  ...\n]`). This is the one point of disagreement
   between pretty_yaml and Prettier --- we follow pretty_yaml. Wrap fires when
   the canonical single-line form would push the line strictly past
   `line_width`; lines exactly at `line_width` stay single-line. Items indent at
   `parent_content_column + 2`; the closing bracket aligns at
   `parent_content_column`. For a flow in a block-map value, the parent content
   column is `2 * (entry/item depth − 1)`; for a flow in a block sequence item,
   the `-` prefix shifts the content column right by two. Nested flow containers
   inside a wrapped item stay in their canonical single-line form (rule 5)
   unless they themselves overflow on the wrapped line. Multi-line flow input (a
   flow container with `\n` between its brackets) currently passes through
   verbatim because the in-tree parser rejects it; the "multi-line input is
   sticky" behavior pretty_yaml shows lands when the parser learns to accept
   those inputs.
7. **Blank lines:** runs of multiple interior blank lines collapse to one max.
   Leading blank lines (before the first content line) are stripped entirely ---
   mirrors rule 13's no-trailing-blanks invariant; preamble whitespace at the
   top of a frontmatter document is never meaningful. Cross-validated against
   pretty_yaml on the `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/blank_lines/` cases.
8. **Inline comments:** exactly one space before `#`. Applies only to inline
   comments (comments with non-whitespace content earlier on the same line);
   standalone comments (preceded by `NEWLINE` or at file start) keep their
   original surrounding whitespace. Implemented inside the token walk because
   line-level passes can't reliably distinguish `#` inside quoted scalars from a
   comment indicator.
9. **Comment positions** (above key, inline, between keys): preserved. Comments
   are user-authored content.
10. **Trailing whitespace** on every line: stripped. ASCII space and tab only
    (CRLF round-trips because `\r` is preserved). Applies uniformly, including
    inside `|`/`>` block scalars --- pretty_yaml does the same; this trades the
    "trailing space carries semantics inside `|`" YAML-spec quirk for the "no
    trailing whitespace anywhere" invariant.
11. **Empty scalars:** `key:` stays `key:`, never canonicalized to `key: null`
    or `key: ""`.
12. **Key order:** preserved. Frontmatter is content the user wrote; reordering
    would surprise.
13. **Trailing document newline:** always exactly one `\n` at EOF. Missing
    trailing newline → add one; multiple trailing newlines → collapse to one.
    Cross-validated against pretty_yaml on the standard zero/one/many cases
    (`tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/document/empty.yaml`,
    `missing_trailing_newline.yaml`, `multiple_trailing_newlines.yaml`).
    Whitespace-only inputs (e.g. `"   "`) are out of scope for rule 13 alone ---
    pretty_yaml canonicalizes those more aggressively, and the divergence
    resolves once the trailing-whitespace rule (#10) lands.
14. **Block-structural spacing.** A whitespace run sitting between a block
    structural indicator (`:` after a block-map key, `-` after a block-sequence
    item marker) and inline content on the same line collapses to exactly one
    space. `key:    value` → `key: value`; `-    item` → `- item`. Trailing-only
    whitespace (`key:   \n  value`) is left to rule 10 to strip; the value's own
    indent line is governed by rule 1. Flow containers normalize `:` / `,`
    spacing through the canonical-emission path (rule 5), so this rule only
    governs block-level structural runs. Added in Phase 1.13 after the real-
    frontmatter harvest surfaced inputs (e.g. `echo:    false`) that rules 1, 5,
    and 8 didn't reach.

## Notes

Rules 4, 9, and 12 are "preserve" rules: they don't add a new behavior, they
explicitly decline to canonicalize a semantically-meaningful user choice.
They're still deterministic.

Rule 3 is the only spec rule with semantic-content awareness. The
escape-required test is decidable from the scalar's bytes alone (no context
dependence), so it remains rule-based.

## Plain-scalar wrapping (config, not spec)

Plain-scalar wrapping is a config option, not a spec rule. It is controlled by
Panache's `wrap` setting, which `yaml_engine.rs` maps onto pretty_yaml's
`ProseWrap`:

- `wrap: preserve` → `ProseWrap::Preserve` --- nothing wraps.
- `wrap: reflow` (default) / `sentence` / `semantic` → `ProseWrap::Always` ---
  plain scalars wrap with +2 indent continuation lines; quoted (`"…"`, `'…'`)
  and block (`>`, `|`) styles never wrap regardless of mode.

The in-tree formatter inherits this mapping at cutover. The spec-adjacent
invariant worth pinning: **only plain scalars are ever wrapped; quoted and block
styles are preserved verbatim regardless of wrap mode**. Wrapping a quoted
scalar would change escape behavior (double-quoted) or require backslash
handling not present in single-quoted; wrapping a block scalar would change `>`
folding or `|` literal semantics.

Edge case worth knowing about: a plain scalar containing `key: value`-shaped
text (colon followed by space, mid-content) is already ambiguous to strict YAML
parsers; wrapping it surfaces the breakage. The in-tree parser will likely
reject this input outright, making the wrap question moot. If we ever silently
accept it, the formatter must avoid wrapping at that boundary.

## Adding a new rule

Adding a 14th rule is a deliberate act. If Phase 1 development surfaces an edge
case neither the spec nor pretty_yaml currently covers, the resolution is a new
rule here (with a one-line rationale and a fixture under
`crates/panache-formatter/tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/`) --- not a special-case
branch in the formatter.

New rules need cross-validation against pretty_yaml before landing. If they
conflict, decide explicitly which is right and document the decision. See
`.claude/rules/yaml-formatter.md` and
`.claude/skills/yaml-formatter-cutover/plan.md` for the process context.
