# In-tree YAML formatter cutover plan

Staged plan for retiring `yaml_parser` and `pretty_yaml` in favor of an
in-tree YAML formatter driven by the in-tree YAML CST. Sibling document
to `SKILL.md`. Annotate the **What landed** block as work progresses,
matching the `scanner-rewrite.md` precedent in `yaml-shadow-expand/`.

## Status

- **Phase 1 (shadow formatter):** in progress. 1.1–1.14 as previously
  recorded; 1.15 extends rule 1 to canonicalize multi-line plain /
  single-quoted / double-quoted scalar continuation lines at
  `2 * entry/item depth` (the value column), surfaced by a Phase 2
  readiness probe that compared in-tree vs pretty_yaml on every host
  fixture's YAML frontmatter and hashpipe payloads. Remaining gap
  before Phase 2: **plain-scalar overflow wrap** (rule 6's analog for
  long single-line plain scalars in block-map values — when the value
  pushes its line past `line_width`, wrap onto multiple lines with
  `depth * 2`-column continuation indent). All three remaining
  `input.* hashpipe` divergences in the readiness probe are this
  shape; their `expected.*` files already match in-tree output, so the
  blocker is producing the wrapped output from unwrapped input.
- **Phase 2 (joint cutover):** not started, blocked on Phase 1.15b
  (plain-scalar overflow wrap). Probe results: 14/14 expected
  frontmatter, 15/15 input frontmatter, 35/35 expected hashpipe, 18/21
  input hashpipe — last three are the wrap gap. Once that lands, the
  cutover commit shouldn't shift any host golden fixture.
- **Phase 3 (hashpipe extension):** not started, blocked on Phase 2.

## What landed since drafting

_(Update as phases complete. Earliest entries on top.)_

- **Phase 1.15 — multi-line scalar continuation canonicalization
  (rule 1 extension).** Probe-driven: a one-shot survey under
  `crates/panache-formatter/tests/yaml_fixture_survey.rs` (now
  removed) ran `format_yaml` and `pretty_yaml::format_text` over the
  YAML frontmatter and hashpipe payloads of every fixture under
  `tests/fixtures/cases/`. Result: 7/35 expected-hashpipe and 8/21
  input-hashpipe divergences clustered around multi-line plain /
  single-quoted / double-quoted scalars whose continuation lines lost
  their indent because rule 1's depth formula
  (`entry/item ancestors − 1`) returned 0 for the continuation line's
  containing entry. Fix: extend `canonical_indent_depth` in
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/document.rs` to handle
  multi-line `YAML_SCALAR` continuation lines explicitly — block
  scalars (`|`/`>`) still preserve verbatim (no real renderer yet);
  plain / single- / double-quoted continuation lines indent at
  `entry/item ancestors * 2` (one level deeper than the default; the
  scalar belongs to the value side of the entry, so its column is the
  value column rather than the key column). Five new corpus cases
  under `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/multiline_scalars/`
  (`plain_continuation_canonical`, `double_quoted_continuation_canonical`,
  `single_quoted_continuation_canonical`,
  `double_quoted_continuation_one_space`,
  `nested_value_continuation`). Two new unit tests in `yaml.rs`
  (`rule_1_canonicalizes_multiline_plain_scalar_continuation`,
  `rule_1_canonicalizes_multiline_quoted_scalar_continuation`).
  STYLE.md rule 1 amended with the value-column note. The probe
  results after this fix: 14/14 expected frontmatter, 15/15 input
  frontmatter, 35/35 expected hashpipe, 18/21 input hashpipe parity.
  The remaining 3 input-hashpipe gaps are all long single-line plain
  scalars that pretty_yaml wraps and the in-tree formatter leaves
  untouched — these are the Phase 2 blocker (plain-scalar overflow
  wrap, rule 6's analog for block-map scalar values). The probe and
  CST shape probes were one-shot tools and were removed after the fix
  landed. No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.14 — multi-line flow round-trip (parser + formatter).**
  Two coupled changes that unblock the "multi-line flow input is
  sticky" behavior parked in Phase 1.10. Parser-side: relaxed
  `check_flow_continuation_indent` in
  `crates/panache-parser/src/parser/yaml/validator.rs` so that a
  continuation line whose first non-whitespace byte is the flow's
  matching closing indicator (`]` for `YAML_FLOW_SEQUENCE`, `}` for
  `YAML_FLOW_MAP`) is exempt from the strict `col > threshold` rule.
  YAML 1.2 §7.1 reads the spec stricter than mainstream parsers — but
  pretty_yaml, libyaml (via pandoc), and yaml.v3 (via yq) all emit
  and accept the closing bracket on its own line at the parent
  block-map's indent column, and the `parser` rule names pandoc as
  the behavioral reference. Verified via probes (pandoc `-t native`
  + yq) on depth-0 closing-`]`, depth-0 closing-`}`, and depth-1
  nested cases. Five new unit tests in
  `parser/yaml/validator.rs::tests` cover accept (depth-0 seq /
  depth-1 seq / depth-0 map) and reject (CML9 comment line at parent
  indent, 9C9N content lines at parent indent) directions; the three
  existing yaml-test-suite snapshots (CML9, 9C9N, VJP3/00) still
  carry their `LEX_WRONG_INDENTED_FLOW` diagnostics because the
  carve-out only spares the closing indicator, not content/comment
  lines at the threshold. Triage regen produced no bucket changes
  (308 passes_now / 94 error_contract_ok unchanged).

  Formatter-side: rule 1's
  `canonical_indent_depth` returns `None` when the offset lands on a
  continuation line of an enclosing multi-line `YAML_FLOW_SEQUENCE` /
  `YAML_FLOW_MAP` (the ancestor flow's text contains a `\n` between
  its start and the offset). Without this carve-out, rule 1 would
  re-indent multi-line flow content as if it were block-map keys at
  depth 0 (column 0), destroying the wrap that rule 6 produced and
  breaking idempotency on every `flow_wrap/*.yaml` corpus case once
  the parser stopped rejecting their pass-1 outputs. Three new
  corpus cases under
  `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/flow_wrap/`
  (`sticky_multiline_depth_0`, `sticky_multiline_depth_1`,
  `sticky_multiline_map`) feed pre-wrapped pretty_yaml output back
  through the harness — they must parity-match pretty_yaml and
  round-trip unchanged. One new unit test in
  `formatter/yaml.rs::tests::rule_6_wrap_round_trips_multiline_input`
  pins the depth-0 seq case at the API level. STYLE.md unchanged
  (the spec already documented rule 6's wrap shape; this fixes
  implementation). No live-pipeline changes — still shadow.
- **Phase 1.13 — real-frontmatter harvest + rule 14
  (block-structural spacing).** Pulled six representative frontmatter
  blocks into `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/real/`:
  `quarto_frontmatter_keywords` (title/author/date/keywords sequence
  from `tests/fixtures/cases/yaml_metadata/`),
  `whitespace_normalization` (the `echo:    false` / `-  a` /
  `-     b` stressor from `yaml_metadata_normalization/`),
  `non_ascii_scalar` (`smörgås` from `umlauts/`),
  `quarto_landing_page` (the full `docs/index.qmd` frontmatter —
  folded scalars, nested `open-graph` / `twitter-card` / `format`
  sub-maps), `folded_description_performance` (folded `description: >`
  + `engine: knitr` from `docs/guide/performance.qmd`), and
  `folded_description_short` (short folded description from
  `docs/guide/formatting.qmd`). Skipped single-line `title: x` cases
  (already covered by `mappings/simple_mapping`) and the
  `yaml_metadata_opening_blank_not_metadata` case (already covered
  by `blank_lines/leading_blank_run`). The `whitespace_normalization`
  case immediately surfaced a spec gap pretty_yaml normalizes but
  rules 1, 5, and 8 didn't reach: runs of whitespace between block
  structural indicators (`:` after a key, `-` after a sequence
  marker) and their inline value. Resolution: a 14th rule, added per
  the `yaml-formatter` rule on deliberate spec extensions.

  Rule 14 implementation: a `WHITESPACE` token whose `prev_token()`
  is `YAML_COLON` or `YAML_BLOCK_SEQ_ENTRY` and whose `next_token()`
  is not `NEWLINE` collapses to a single space. Composed into
  `emit_token` via an OR with rule 8's
  `is_ws_before_inline_comment` — both want the same output for the
  shared `key:    # comment` shape, so no precedence conflict. Three
  new corpus cases under `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/structural_spacing/`
  (`multiple_spaces_after_colon`, `multiple_spaces_after_dash`,
  `tab_after_colon`) plus the harvested `real/whitespace_normalization`
  case lock the behavior. Two new unit tests in `yaml.rs`
  (`rule_14_collapses_run_after_colon`,
  `rule_14_collapses_run_after_dash`) cover the trailing-WS carve-out
  (`key:   \n  inner: v` keeps the trailing WS untouched for rule 10
  to strip) and the bare-`-` case (`-   \n  - foo` keeps the dash
  alone, not `- ` + nothing). STYLE.md amended: header notes rules
  1–12 + 14 share a 15-case cross-validation battery with Prettier,
  rule 13 + 14 were cross-validated against pretty_yaml later in the
  corpus harness rollout. yaml.rs module doc-comment bumped to 1.13.
  No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.12 — preserve-rule lockdown (rules 4, 9, 11, 12).** No
  formatter code; locks in the four spec rules that explicitly decline
  to canonicalize a semantically-meaningful user choice by giving each
  corpus + unit coverage that cross-validates against pretty_yaml.
  Eleven new corpus cases. Under
  `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/block_scalars/`: `literal_preserved`,
  `folded_preserved`, `literal_strip`, `folded_keep`, `literal_in_seq`,
  `folded_then_literal` — exercise `|`, `>`, `|-`, `>+`, and mixed
  literal/folded usage in both block-map values and block-sequence
  items. Under `comments/`: `between_keys`, `between_seq_items`,
  `trailing_doc_comment`, `blank_separated_section` — exercise rule
  9's position-preservation at the doc-end, between map keys, between
  sequence items, and across a blank-line section boundary. Under
  `empty_values/`: `bare_empty`, `multiple_empties`,
  `empty_with_inline_comment`, `empty_in_sequence` — exercise rule
  11's no-`null` canonicalization across bare, stacked, comment-
  trailed, and sequence-position empties. Under `key_order/`:
  `reverse_alpha_preserved`, `numeric_like_keys_preserved`,
  `deep_order_preserved` — exercise rule 12 with reverse-alphabetic
  top-level keys, quoted numeric keys (avoids stringification
  surprises), and reverse order at two nesting levels. Four new unit
  tests in `yaml.rs` (`rule_4_block_scalar_style_preserved`,
  `rule_9_comment_positions_preserved`,
  `rule_11_empty_scalars_preserved`, `rule_12_key_order_preserved`)
  lock the behavior at the API level so a future regression doesn't
  ride along with a pretty_yaml regression silently. yaml.rs module
  doc-comment bumped to 1.12 with the preserve-rule note. No
  live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.11 — rule 3 (quote-style preference).** Added
  `try_convert_single_to_double` to
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/document.rs::emit_token`.
  Strategy: for any token whose text starts and ends with `'` (length
  ≥ 2), strip outer quotes and de-escape (`''` → `'`), then check the
  content for any of `\`, `'`, `"`, or ASCII control char (< 0x20 or
  0x7F). If found, emit verbatim (keep single). Else emit `"<content>"`
  (convert to double). Brackets/commas inside flow containers are also
  `YAML_SCALAR` tokens but their text never starts with `'`, so the
  prefix check filters them out. Plain and double-quoted scalars pass
  through unchanged — never up-quote plain to double or down-quote
  double to single, matching pretty_yaml's "preserve user choice except
  for the one safe direction" behavior. Conservative on control chars:
  pretty_yaml escapes literal `\t` / `\n` into double-quoted form when
  converting, but we keep single in those cases (frontmatter rarely has
  literal control characters in quoted scalars; the escape logic adds
  complexity for little real-world benefit). Eleven new corpus cases
  under `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/quotes/`:
  `single_to_double_simple`, `single_to_double_with_space`,
  `single_to_double_with_colon`, `single_keeps_with_backslash`,
  `single_keeps_with_apostrophe`, `single_keeps_with_doublequote`,
  `double_stays_double`, `plain_stays_plain`,
  `empty_single_becomes_double`, `single_key_converts`,
  `flow_singles_convert`, `seq_singles_convert`. Three new unit tests in
  `yaml.rs` covering the single→double conversion paths, the
  conservative-keep paths, and key/flow-context coverage. STYLE.md
  rule 3 amended with the operational rule (the spec's preference
  order doesn't strip quotes from plain or down-quote double; it's
  applied at the single→double conversion boundary) and the
  control-char carve-out. yaml.rs and document.rs status blocks bumped
  to 1.11. No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.10 — rule 6 (overflow wrap).** Added `apply_flow_wrap` to
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/document.rs::render`,
  inserted between rule 1 (indent canonicalization) and rule 10
  (trailing-WS strip). Strategy: re-parse the post-rule-1 buffer with
  the in-tree YAML parser, walk top-level (`!has_flow_ancestor`)
  `YAML_FLOW_SEQUENCE` / `YAML_FLOW_MAP` nodes in reverse byte order,
  and replace any whose canonical single-line form + the container's
  containing-line context exceeds `opts.line_width`. Wrap layout
  follows pretty_yaml: opening bracket stays on the key line; each
  item indented at `parent_content_column + 2`; trailing comma after
  every item; closing bracket on its own line at
  `parent_content_column`. `parent_content_column` =
  `2 * (entry/item depth − 1)` for a flow in a block-map value, and
  the same +2 for a flow in a block-sequence item — the `- ` prefix
  shifts the content column right by two. Nested flow containers
  inside a wrapped item stay in their canonical rule-5 single-line
  form (matches pretty_yaml's seq-of-maps output). The wrap threshold
  is strict `>`: lines exactly at `line_width` (default 80) stay
  single-line; lines at `line_width + 1` wrap. Re-parsing on rule 6
  is bounded by the in-tree parser's known limitation: multi-line
  flow containers (a flow with `\n` between brackets) currently fail
  to parse, so `format_yaml` already passed the input through
  verbatim before `render` was reached — the "multi-line input is
  sticky" behavior pretty_yaml shows is parked on parser support for
  those inputs. Idempotency holds because run 2 of a wrapped output
  hits the multi-line-flow parser-rejection path and passes through
  verbatim. Seven new corpus cases under
  `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/flow_wrap/`: `overflow_depth_0`,
  `overflow_depth_1`, `overflow_depth_2`, `overflow_in_block_seq`,
  `overflow_map`, `overflow_seq_of_maps`, `exactly_80_no_wrap`. Four
  new unit tests in `yaml.rs` (depth-0 wrap with at-80 / over-80
  boundary, depth-1 wrap alignment, block-sequence parent +4 shift,
  nested flow stays canonical). STYLE.md rule 6 amended with the
  wrap-decision formula, the parent-content-column math, the nested
  flow rule, and the multi-line-input deferral. yaml.rs status block
  bumped to 1.10. No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.9 — rule 5 (canonical flow spacing) + recursive walker.**
  Refactored the token walk into a recursive node walk
  (`walk_with_normalization` → `emit_node` → `emit_token`) so flow
  containers can take over emission for their subtree.
  `YAML_FLOW_SEQUENCE` emits `[item, item, ...]` (no inner space, one
  space after `,`); `YAML_FLOW_MAP` emits `{ k: v, ... }` (one inner
  space, one space after `,`, one space after `:`). When the parser
  couldn't structure a flow map's content into `YAML_FLOW_MAP_ENTRY`
  children (e.g. `{key:value}` — no space to disambiguate `:`), the
  inner bytes are emitted verbatim between `{ ` and ` }` — matches
  pretty_yaml's "normalize spacing around structure, don't re-parse
  content" behavior. Multi-line flow containers and flow containers
  with embedded `YAML_COMMENT` tokens fall through to the generic
  recursive path and emit verbatim (rule 6 will own multi-line wrap;
  in-flow comments are too rare to justify their own canonical path).
  Rule 8 (inline comment WS normalization) was re-anchored to
  `SyntaxToken::prev_token()` / `next_token()` so it works during the
  recursive walk without an array index. Nine new corpus cases under
  `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/flow/`: `canonical_sequence`,
  `canonical_map`, `empty_sequence`, `empty_map`,
  `sequence_no_comma_space`, `sequence_extra_space`,
  `map_no_inner_space`, `map_extra_inner_space`, `map_no_comma_space`,
  `map_pathological_no_spaces`, `nested_seq_of_maps`, `nested_maps`,
  `sequence_inside_block_sequence`. Two new unit tests
  (`rule_5_flow_spacing_canonicalized` and
  `rule_5_multiline_flow_preserved_verbatim`). STYLE.md rule 5
  amended with the in-flow-comment / multi-line scope and the
  unparseable-content pass-through behavior. yaml.rs status block
  bumped to 1.9. No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.8 — rule 8 (inline comment spacing) + pipeline refactor.**
  Added `walk_with_inline_comment_normalization` and
  `is_ws_before_inline_comment` to
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/document.rs`. During the
  token walk, when a `WHITESPACE` token's contiguous-WS run ends with
  a `YAML_COMMENT` AND the previous non-WHITESPACE token is not
  `NEWLINE`, the WS is emitted as a single space. Standalone
  comments (line-start) keep original surrounding WS. Rule 8 had to
  run inside the token walk because line-level passes can't reliably
  distinguish `#` inside quoted scalars from a comment indicator.
  Since rule 8 changes byte counts after a line's first non-WS byte
  (collapsing `   ` → ` `), the existing rule-1 implementation's
  CST-offset lookup (`line_start + trimmed_start`) would no longer
  map to CST. Refactored: `precompute_line_depths` walks
  `root.text()` line-by-line and computes the canonical depth per
  CST line up front; `apply_canonical_indents` iterates the
  (post-rule-8) buffer in lockstep — rule 8 preserves `\n` positions,
  so the line index alignment holds. Five new corpus cases under
  `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/comments/`:
  `inline_loose_spacing`, `inline_tight_spacing`, `multiple_inline`,
  `nested_inline`, `standalone_above_key`. One new unit test in
  `yaml.rs`. STYLE.md rule 8 amended with the inline/standalone
  distinction and the in-walk implementation note. yaml.rs status
  block bumped to 1.8. No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.7 — rule 7 (blank-line collapse) + rule 2 verification.**
  Added `collapse_blank_line_runs` to
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/document.rs::render`,
  applied after rule 10 (so whitespace-only "blank" lines participate)
  and before rule 13 (so trailing residue gets finalized to one `\n`).
  Interior runs of multiple blank lines collapse to one; leading
  blank lines are stripped entirely — symmetric with rule 13's
  no-trailing-blank-lines invariant. Probed pretty_yaml first: it
  also strips leading blanks (not just collapses), so STYLE.md
  rule 7 was extended to call that out explicitly rather than
  leaving "one max" ambiguous. Rule 2 (sequence items indented +2
  from parent key) verified: rule 1's depth formula
  (`2 * (entry/item ancestors − 1)`) already canonicalizes
  same-column inputs (`categories:\n- foo` → `categories:\n  - foo`)
  because the `-` sits inside two entry/item ancestors. No new code
  for rule 2 — three corpus cases plus a unit test lock the
  behavior. Four new corpus cases under
  `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/blank_lines/`
  (`triple_blank_collapses`, `multiple_runs`, `single_blank_preserved`,
  `whitespace_only_blanks_collapse`, `leading_blank_run`) and three
  under `sequences/` (`parent_column_dashes`, `nested_parent_column`,
  `sequence_of_mappings_parent_column`). Two new unit tests in
  `yaml.rs`. yaml.rs status block bumped to 1.7. No live-pipeline
  changes.
- **Phase 1.6 — rule 1 (canonical 2-space indent).** Added
  `canonicalize_line_indents` + `canonical_indent_depth` to
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/document.rs`. Strategy:
  walk tokens to build a raw output buffer (byte-lossless), then
  line-rewrite leading whitespace per `2 * (entry/item ancestor
  count − 1)` for each line's first non-WS byte (looked up against
  the CST via `token_at_offset`). Run before rule 10 + rule 13.
  Tab-indented input is rejected by the parser outright — no
  formatter concern. Block scalar (`|`/`>`) interior lines are
  detected (offset > scalar_start, multi-line scalar text starting
  with the indicator) and pass through verbatim because the scalar
  is one multi-line `YAML_SCALAR` token; proper canonicalization
  needs a real block-scalar renderer (deferred — added as an open
  question below and noted in STYLE.md rule 1). Four new corpus
  cases under `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/indent/`:
  `nested_mapping_4sp`, `triple_nested_4sp`, `sequence_in_mapping_4sp`,
  `sequence_of_mappings_canonical` (the canonical sequence-of-mappings
  case earns its keep as a structural shape stressor even though it
  doesn't reshape indent). Two new unit tests covering the nested
  collapse cases and the block-scalar passthrough. STYLE.md rule 1
  amended with the depth formula and the block-scalar limitation;
  yaml.rs status block bumped to 1.6. No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.5 — rule 10 (strip trailing whitespace per line).** Added
  `strip_trailing_whitespace_per_line` to
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/document.rs::render`,
  applied before rule 13. Strips ASCII space + tab from every line;
  leaves `\r` so CRLF round-trips. Applies uniformly — including
  inside `|`/`>` block scalars, where YAML semantically pins trailing
  spaces as content. Matches pretty_yaml's behavior (probed before
  implementing); STYLE.md rule 10 amended to note the deliberate
  semantic trade. Six new corpus cases under
  `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/`: `whitespace/{trailing_spaces_on_value,
  whitespace_only_blank_line, comment_trailing_spaces, trailing_tab,
  literal_block_trailing}.yaml` plus `document/whitespace_only.yaml`
  (3 ASCII spaces, no newline — resolves the rule-13 era divergence
  for whitespace-only input). Files written via `printf` because
  the Write tool's hook strips per-line trailing whitespace. One new
  unit test in `yaml.rs` covering the four shapes. Workspace test
  suite still green. No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.4 — rule 13 (trailing document newline).** Added
  `normalize_trailing_newline` to
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/document.rs::render`:
  every successfully-parsed document now ends with exactly one `\n`
  (zero → add; many → collapse). Verified the in-tree parser
  preserves trailing newlines byte-for-byte across the
  zero/one/many cases — resolved the
  "lossless parser preservation of trailing newline" open question
  below. Added three corpus cases under
  `tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/document/`
  (`empty.yaml` (0 bytes), `missing_trailing_newline.yaml`,
  `multiple_trailing_newlines.yaml`) plus three new unit tests in
  `yaml.rs`. Whitespace-only inputs (e.g. `"   "`) are still a
  divergence — pretty_yaml canonicalizes those to `"\n"`; resolves
  once rule 10 (strip per-line trailing whitespace) lands.
  STYLE.md rule 13 footnote updated to note cross-validation;
  yaml.rs status block bumped to 1.4. No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.3 — cross-validation harness.** Added
  `crates/panache-formatter/tests/yaml_cross_validation.rs`, which
  discovers every `*.yaml` under
  `crates/panache-formatter/tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/` and, per
  case, asserts (a) `format_yaml(input) == pretty_yaml::format_text(input)`
  with options bridged the same way `yaml_engine.rs` bridges them
  (`print_width` ← `line_width`, `prose_wrap` ← `wrap`, everything
  else at pretty_yaml defaults) and (b) `format_yaml(format_yaml(x)) ==
  format_yaml(x)`. Failures accumulate into one panic so a batch of
  red cases is visible at once. Seeded the corpus with 8 trivially-
  canonical inputs (simple/two-key/nested mappings, top-level + nested
  sequences, leading comment, short flow sequence, doc-start marker)
  that round-trip through pretty_yaml's defaults — chosen so the
  Phase 1.1 byte-passthrough stub passes parity and idempotency
  today. The plan's Phase 1.3 "corpus seeding" intent (real
  frontmatter extracts, hand-picked stressors for flow overflow /
  anchors / multi-line scalars) deferred to land alongside the rule
  implementations that make each case pass — adding them now would
  just enumerate divergences, which is exactly what the
  yaml-formatter rule forbids. yaml.rs module doc-comment updated to
  reflect the 1.3 status. No live-pipeline changes.
- **Phase 1.2 — STYLE.md relocation.** Moved the 13-rule style spec
  out of this plan into
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/STYLE.md` (canonical
  home). Added a pointer from `docs/guide/formatting.qmd` in the
  YAML frontmatter section so user-facing docs reach the spec.
  Updated the `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml.rs`
  module doc-comment to cite `STYLE.md` instead of the now-relocated
  plan-side spec. No behavior change; the formatter module is still
  the Phase 1.1 byte-passthrough stub. Plan retains rollout context
  and references STYLE.md from the spec section below.
- **Phase 1.1 — module skeleton.** Added
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml.rs` (parent) and the
  six submodule files (`options.rs`, `document.rs`, `block_map.rs`,
  `block_sequence.rs`, `flow.rs`, `scalar.rs`) under
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/`. Public entry
  `format_yaml(text, &YamlFormatOptions) -> String` calls
  `panache_parser::parser::yaml::parse_yaml_tree`, walks the CST, and
  emits tokens verbatim (byte-lossless stub — applies no style rules
  yet). Module wired into `formatter.rs` as `pub mod yaml;` behind an
  `#[allow(dead_code)]` shadow marker; not reachable from the live
  pipeline. Compiles clean; clippy clean; two unit-test smokes pass.
  Plan amended to spell out the no-`mod.rs` layout rule, matching the
  project convention from AGENTS.md.

## Context

The in-tree streaming YAML parser is event-parity complete against
yaml-test-suite (`crates/panache-parser/tests/yaml/triage.json`:
308 passes_now, 94 error_contract_ok, both `fails_needs_*` buckets
empty). It has a lossless CST and a delegated scalar-cooking module.

It has no formatter consumer. The live pipeline still uses the legacy
`yaml_parser` crate via `crates/panache-parser/src/syntax/yaml.rs` for
the CST, and `pretty_yaml::format_text` via
`crates/panache-formatter/src/yaml_engine.rs` for output. The in-tree
parser is therefore unproven on the dimensions a formatter would
exercise — CST shape (trivia attachment, comment placement, indent
grouping) rather than event stream.

A pure parser cutover would swap internals with no user-visible
payoff; its parity bar is too weak to catch shape gaps. A formatter
gives the cutover a downstream consumer and a real parity bar.

## Goals

- One pipeline end-to-end: in-tree parser → in-tree formatter.
- `yaml_parser` and `pretty_yaml` both retired in the cutover commit.
- **Rule-based deterministic style** — output follows the style spec
  below, not a tool's whims. pretty_yaml is used as a cross-validation
  reference because it implements the same rules; it is not the
  source of truth.
- Strong idempotency invariant: `format(format(x)) == format(x)`
  asserted in the corpus harness, not as a separate test.
- Plain metadata first; hashpipe inherits via existing
  `normalize_hashpipe_input` once Phase 2 lands.

## Non-goals

- Replacing yaml-test-suite event parity. That bar stays.
- Tracking pretty_yaml's choices when they conflict with the style
  spec. If pretty_yaml ever drifts from the spec on an edge case, we
  follow the spec and either fix pretty_yaml upstream or work around
  in the corpus harness.
- Wiring the in-tree formatter into the live path before Phase 2.

## Style spec

The canonical 13-rule style spec lives in
[`crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/STYLE.md`](../../../crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/STYLE.md).
That file is the source of truth for what the in-tree formatter
emits; this plan tracks rollout, not the spec itself.

The spec is deterministic (same input → same output) and was
cross-validated against pretty_yaml 0.6.0 and Prettier 3.6.2 on a
15-case battery of representative frontmatter — both agree on rules
1–12; rule 6's bracket placement is the one point where they differ,
and the rule pins pretty_yaml's choice. Rule 13 (trailing document
newline) is not yet cross-validated; that gets done as part of the
Phase 1.3 corpus harness.

Adding a 14th rule is a deliberate act and follows the process
documented in [`yaml-formatter`](../../rules/yaml-formatter.md): a new
rule in STYLE.md with a one-line rationale and a fixture under
`crates/panache-formatter/tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/`, plus an
explicit decision when it conflicts with pretty_yaml's behavior.

## Phase 1 — Shadow in-tree formatter (plain metadata)

Build `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/` consuming the
in-tree parser CST. Not wired to the live pipeline.

### 1.1 — Module skeleton

Follow the project's modern-Rust layout convention: a parent `yaml.rs`
file declares the submodules; per-feature code sits in sibling files
under `yaml/`. **No `mod.rs`** anywhere in the tree (see AGENTS.md).

- `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml.rs` — parent module.
  Public entry: `format_yaml(text: &str, opts: &YamlFormatOptions) -> String`.
  Declares the submodules below.
- `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/` — submodule files:
  - `document.rs` — top-level document orchestration.
  - `block_map.rs`, `block_sequence.rs`, `flow.rs`, `scalar.rs` —
    per-CST-node rendering.
  - `options.rs` — `YamlFormatOptions` (line-width, wrap mode, quote
    style preference, …).
- Wire into the formatter crate by adding `pub mod yaml;` to
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter.rs`.
- Initial entry calls into in-tree parser via
  `panache_parser::parser::yaml::parse_yaml_tree(text)`, walks the
  returned CST, emits text.

### 1.2 — Move style spec into the module

Landed: the 13-rule spec lives in
`crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/yaml/STYLE.md`, with a
pointer from `docs/guide/formatting.qmd` (YAML frontmatter section).
This plan no longer carries the spec; it tracks rollout only.

If Phase 1 development discovers a 14th rule (an edge case neither
the spec nor pretty_yaml currently covers), add it to STYLE.md with
a fixture and a one-line rationale. New rules need cross-validation
against pretty_yaml before landing — if they conflict, decide
explicitly which is right and document the decision.

### 1.3 — Cross-validation harness

New test file
`crates/panache-formatter/tests/yaml_cross_validation.rs`. For each
case in the corpus:

1. Read `input.yaml`.
2. `let in_tree = panache_formatter::formatter::yaml::format_yaml(input, &opts);`
3. `let pretty = pretty_yaml::format_text(input, &opts)?;`
4. Assert `in_tree == pretty` (rule 6's bracket placement matches
   pretty_yaml, so this should hold across the corpus).
5. Assert `format_yaml(in_tree, ...) == in_tree` (idempotency).
6. If `in_tree != pretty`: it's a bug in (a) the in-tree formatter,
   (b) the in-tree parser CST shape, or (c) pretty_yaml. Diagnose
   and fix — do NOT add the case to a divergence list. The corpus
   is calibration data for the spec, not a divergence registry.

Corpus seeding:
- Pull real frontmatter from existing
  `tests/fixtures/cases/*/input.{md,qmd,Rmd}` (extract the YAML
  region).
- Add `crates/panache-formatter/tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/` with
  hand-picked cases that stress comments, multi-line scalars,
  anchors, tags, and flow overflow (rule 6).
- Optionally cycle in a slice of the yaml-test-suite plain cases that
  pretty_yaml handles cleanly.

### 1.4 — CST shape gaps surfaced by the harness

Expected outcome of Phase 1 is a list of parser-side fixes driven by
formatter symptoms. Track each fix as a separate parser commit (per
[`formatter`](../../rules/formatter.md) rule on idempotency
root-causing).

### Exit criteria for Phase 1

- Every corpus case satisfies `in_tree == pretty` and idempotency.
- STYLE.md is the canonical spec; this plan no longer carries it.
- Any parser CST shape gaps surfaced by the harness are fixed in
  `panache-parser` (separate commits).

## Phase 2 — Joint cutover

When Phase 1 exits, swap parser and formatter in one commit.

### 2.1 — Parser side

- Update `crates/panache-parser/src/syntax/yaml.rs` to call the
  in-tree parser (`parse_yaml_report`) and surface its CST shape into
  the host CST.
- Audit downstream consumers of the YAML CST shape: linter rules,
  LSP, anything that walks
  `SyntaxKind::YAML_*` nodes. The in-tree parser's `YAML_*` kinds
  must already be the host CST's kinds for this to be a no-op (verify
  before cutover).

### 2.2 — Formatter side

- Replace `crates/panache-formatter/src/yaml_engine.rs::format_text`
  call with `formatter::yaml::format_yaml`.
- Remove the `pretty_yaml` dependency from
  `crates/panache-formatter/Cargo.toml`.
- Remove the `yaml_parser` dependency from `Cargo.toml` (root).

### 2.3 — Golden case regen

Expect host-level golden cases under `tests/fixtures/cases/*/` to
shift on YAML-affecting cases. Each delta must:
- Match the style spec (and pretty_yaml's output, by construction), or
- Be a fix for a known bug captured by a `tests/yaml_corpus/` case, or
- Be challenged before accepting.

### Exit criteria for Phase 2

- `yaml_parser` and `pretty_yaml` removed from `Cargo.lock`.
- All host golden cases green; deltas annotated.
- `cargo test` workspace green.
- Triage of parser-side regressions (if any) — should be zero per the
  shape audit, but verify.

## Phase 3 — Hashpipe extension

Same parser + formatter, exercised through the existing hashpipe
normalization path.

### 3.1 — Wire-up

- `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/hashpipe.rs` already calls
  the YAML engine for option bodies. Re-point it to
  `formatter::yaml::format_yaml` with hashpipe normalization.
- Confirm `normalize_hashpipe_input` behaviour matches what the
  formatter expects (it strips `#|`; the formatter re-prefixes).

### 3.2 — Hashpipe-specific fixtures

Add cases under
`crates/panache-formatter/tests/fixtures/yaml_corpus/hashpipe/` for:
- Continuation lines (`#| key: value\n#|   continued`).
- Blank-line semantics inside `#|`.
- Anchors / tags in chunk options.
- The existing `issue_*_hashpipe_*` host fixtures should drop their
  pretty_yaml-specific quirks at this point — re-check each.

### Exit criteria for Phase 3

- Hashpipe and plain metadata share one formatter path governed by
  the same style spec.
- All host hashpipe golden cases green; pretty_yaml-specific
  workarounds in `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/hashpipe.rs`
  removed.

## Open questions

- **YamlFormatOptions surface.** Mirror pretty_yaml's option surface
  in the in-tree formatter, or design our own from scratch? Mirroring
  eases the cutover; designing fresh avoids inheriting quirks. Note:
  the spec is fixed; options control orthogonal knobs like
  `line-width` and `prose-wrap`, not style choices.
- **Salsa integration.** Does the formatter need its own salsa input,
  or piggyback on the parser's `YamlInput` from
  `crates/panache-parser/src/parser/yaml/model.rs`?
- **Style-as-CST-kind promotion.** Deferred in `scanner-rewrite.md`,
  but the formatter may force it (rule 4 requires distinguishing
  `|` / `>` / `'…'` / `"…"` styles per-scalar). Decide before Phase
  1.1 lands whether to do this preemptively or reactively.
- ~~**Lossless parser preservation of trailing newline.**~~
  Resolved in Phase 1.4. The parser round-trips zero/one/many
  trailing newlines byte-for-byte (verified by probe; the formatter
  applies rule 13 on top in `document::render`).
- **Block-scalar interior re-indent.** Rule 1's line-rewrite
  approach treats each block scalar (`|`/`>`) as one multi-line
  `YAML_SCALAR` token and preserves its interior verbatim. That
  keeps parity on already-canonical block scalars but diverges from
  pretty_yaml when the input uses non-canonical indent (e.g. 4-space
  inside a literal block re-flows to 2-space under pretty_yaml). Two
  paths to fix: (a) lift the indent-indicator and content lines into
  separate CST tokens parser-side (cleanest, but a real parser
  change), or (b) keep the token shape and have the formatter
  re-indent the scalar text bytes during rule 1, using the
  block-scalar header to compute the canonical indent. Option (b) is
  smaller and likely the right Phase 1.7+ move. Picked up when the
  formatter starts caring about non-canonical block-scalar inputs
  (no urgent corpus pressure yet).
